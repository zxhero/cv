## Currently

Studying under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://asg.ict.ac.cn/cmy/">Mingyu Chen</a>, 

in Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).


## Research interests

My researches mainly focus on how to mitigate the significant letancy of accessing far memory, which poses an urgent and challenging problem for both **Memory Disaggregation System** and **Distributed Shared-Memory System**. I have explored a general hardware approach and a more specialized software approach targeted at **Graph Computing**.

## Acknowledgment

Currently, I am engaged in close collaboration with Prof. Ke Zhang, A.P. Yisong Chang, and A.P. Tianyue Lu on my research endeavors. To conduct my experiments and drive researches forward, We have established a robust infrastructure using the FPGA cloud platform [SERVE](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/213194605) and the powerful hybrid memory trace toolkit [HMTT](http://asg.ict.ac.cn/hmtt/).

The SERVE platform provids us with access to FPGA resources in the cloud. Leveraging the scalability and parallel processing capabilities of FPGAs, we can implement distributed multi-FPGA platform and optimize complex algorithms, enabling us to tackle challenging research problems.

We rely on the HMTT toolkit offering capabilities for capturing and analyzing memory traces. By leveraging a DIMM-snooping mechanism and software-controlled tracing, HMTT enables us to gain deep insights into memory behavior and correlate it with high-level events.
